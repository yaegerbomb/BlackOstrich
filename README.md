## History

Initial checkin is a stable working build.

## Credits

The many people that have already suffered through GTK# documentation and wrote out many exampled to help me build this.

Hyperdesktop - This program was modeled after it. It recently stopped working so I needed something to replace it. So why not make my own?

4. Make edits to image (be able to draw on top of image and upload the image + changes)

## Additional Notes

This was made in my free time and as a personal challenge to learn something new. I will every now and then add something new. There is no timeline. Feel free to contact me if you are looking for help on the program.
