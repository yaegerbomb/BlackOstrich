# BlackOstrich

The purpose of this program is to crop a section of your desktop and save it as an image to imgur. After imgur upload, the url is copied to your clipboard.

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`

## History

Initial checkin is a stable working build.

## Credits

The many people that have already suffered through GTK# documentation and wrote out many exampled to help me build this.

Hyperdesktop - This program was modeled after it. It recently stopped working so I needed something to replace it. So why not make my own?

## Future Features

2. Options to set custom hotkey
3. Hotkey to upload desktop image to imgur without crop
4. Make edits to image (be able to draw on top of image and upload the image + changes)

## Additional Notes

This was made in my free time and as a personal challenge to learn something new. I will every now and then add something new. There is no timeline. Feel free to contact me if you are looking for help on the program.
